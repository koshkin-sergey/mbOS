# mbOS
mbOS is a free, open-source embedded operating system. It includes all the features you need to develop a connected product based on an Arm microcontroller, including connectivity, an RTOS and drivers for sensors and I/O devices.

With an RTOS core based on the CMSIS-RTOS specification, mbOS supports deterministic, multithreaded real time software execution. The RTOS primitives are always available, allowing drivers and applications to rely on features such as threads, semaphores and mutexes.

Currently mbOS is available for the following architectures:

- ARM Cortex-M cores: Cortex-M0/M0+/M1/M3/M4
- ARM7, ARM9 and ARM11 processor families (Thumb and ARM Modes)
- KMX32 core, development of LLC "KM211"

mbOS is tested across Arm Compiler 5, Arm Compiler 6, GCC and IAR compiler.
